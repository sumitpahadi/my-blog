The core idea behind machine learning is to allow computers to identify patterns and make data-driven decisions based on examples or past experiences.In traditional programming, developers write explicit rules and instructions to solve a specific problem. However, in machine learning, the computer is trained using large amounts of data to learn from patterns and generalize its understanding to new, unseen data.",
