Whether it's a grilled sizzler or a scrumptious burger, fries can go a long way in improving the taste of our favourite dishes. Pairing French fries with dips or sauces can enhance their taste to a whole new level! Among all our favourite dips, the classic ketchup is the one we feel goes best with French fries. And now, a new way of scooping in more ketchup with each French fry has piqued our curiousity. A Twitter user shared a picture of interesting spoon-shaped fries that seemed to be a much-needed innovation. Take a look: The photo was shared by user @TrungTPhan on Twitter. The perfect product-market fit, he wrote in the caption. The post has received over 435k views and hundreds of comments and likes. In the click, we could see how the shape of the usual French fries had been transformed and made into a little spoon. Thus, one end of the French fries could be used to scoop out extra ketchup, mayonnaise or any other dip of choice. Thus, you would not need to take extra fries or dip them a second time",
