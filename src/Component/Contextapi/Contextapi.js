MongoDB is known for its scalability, performance, and ability to handle large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, designed to simplify the process of building robust and scalable server-side applications and APIs. Express.js provides a set of features for handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware.React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily used for building dynamic and interactive frontend applications. React allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently update the user interface using a virtual DOM.Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that enables server-side execution of JavaScript code. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it efficient for handling concurrent connections and real-time applications.",
